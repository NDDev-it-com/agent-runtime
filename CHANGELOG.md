# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The project follows Semantic
Versioning and uses an unstable `v1alpha1` manifest until its first stable
contract.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Provider-neutral immutable `v1alpha1` lifecycle envelopes for Task, Goal, and
  Brain/Orchestrator/Dispatcher/Worker handoff observations.
- Fail-closed typed redaction with nested structure, cycle, formatter, unsafe
  value, Unicode/binary, depth, collection, string, attribute, stream, envelope,
  replay, and file bounds.
- Composable synchronous sinks, bounded memory and durable JSONL implementations,
  delivery reports, retry/idempotency/replay semantics, and Task/Goal adapters.
- Event JSON Schema, documentation, and deep race/fuzz/leak/restart/concurrency/
  failure tests.

### Changed

- Task manifests expose additive `Prepare` validation so observers distinguish
  validation failure from execution without changing Runner behavior.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Strict `v1alpha1` JSON Task manifest and validation API.
- Durable `v1alpha1` Goal journal with an eight-phase state machine, living
  acceptance checklist, typed receipts, atomic updates, and guarded closure.
- Workspace and symlink-confined instruction context assembly.
- Environment allowlisting, timeout, cancellation, and bounded output capture.
- Embeddable Go runner and `validate`, `run`, and `version` CLI commands.
- Race-tested unit, integration, fuzz-seed, CI, security, and public project
  documentation foundations.
- GNU AGPL-3.0-only licensing with source, schema, and documentation parity
  checks against the canonical sibling license text when available.
- Checked CI security-tool contract that preserves Go 1.24 library compatibility
  while running pinned `govulncheck` v1.6.0 under its required Go 1.25 toolchain.
